If a caller attempts to create a job with the same name as an active job that already exists, the attempt returns the existing job. The name must match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]{0,1022}[a-z0-9])?`

                      Sets the policy for determining when to turndown worker pool. Allowed values are: `TEARDOWN_ALWAYS`, `TEARDOWN_ON_SUCCESS`, and `TEARDOWN_NEVER`. `TEARDOWN_ALWAYS` means workers are always torn down regardless of whether the job succeeds. `TEARDOWN_ON_SUCCESS` means workers are torn down if the job succeeds. `TEARDOWN_NEVER` means the workers are never torn down. If the workers are not torn down by the service, they will continue to run and use Google Compute Engine VM resources in the user's project until they are explicitly terminated by the user. Because of this, Google recommends using the `TEARDOWN_ALWAYS` policy except for small, manually supervised test jobs. If unknown or unspecified, the service will attempt to choose a reasonable default.

If unknown or unspecified, the service will attempt to choose a reasonable default. For example, the standard persistent disk type is a resource name typically ending in "pd-standard". If SSD persistent disks are available, the resource name typically ends with "pd-ssd". The actual valid values are defined the Google Compute Engine API, not by the Cloud Dataflow API; consult the Google Compute Engine documentation for more information about determining the set of available disk types for a particular project and zone. Google Compute Engine Disk types are local to a particular project in a particular zone, and so the resource name will typically look something like this: compute.googleapis.com/projects/project-id/zones/zone/diskTypes/pd-standard

          The client's unique identifier of the job, re-used across retried attempts. If this field is set, the service will ensure its uniqueness. The request to create a job will fail if the service has knowledge of a previously submitted job with the same client's ID and job name. The caller may use this field to ensure idempotence of job creation across retried attempts to create a job. By default, the field is empty and, in that case, the service ignores it.

Allowed values are: `TEARDOWN_ALWAYS`, `TEARDOWN_ON_SUCCESS`, and `TEARDOWN_NEVER`. `TEARDOWN_ALWAYS` means workers are always torn down regardless of whether the job succeeds. `TEARDOWN_ON_SUCCESS` means workers are torn down if the job succeeds. `TEARDOWN_NEVER` means the workers are never torn down. If the workers are not torn down by the service, they will continue to run and use Google Compute Engine VM resources in the user's project until they are explicitly terminated by the user. Because of this, Google recommends using the `TEARDOWN_ALWAYS` policy except for small, manually supervised test jobs.

                            Disk storage type, as defined by Google Compute Engine. This must be a disk type appropriate to the project and zone in which the workers will run. If unknown or unspecified, the service will attempt to choose a reasonable default. For example, the standard persistent disk type is a resource name typically ending in "pd-standard". If SSD persistent disks are available, the resource name typically ends with "pd-ssd". The actual valid values are defined the Google Compute Engine API, not by the Cloud Dataflow API; consult the Google Compute Engine documentation for more information about determining the set of available disk types for a particular project and zone. Google Compute Engine Disk types are local to a particular project in a particular zone, and so the resource name will typically look something like this: compute.googleapis.com/projects/project-id/zones/zone/diskTypes/pd-standard

The caller may use this field to ensure idempotence of job creation across retried attempts to create a job. By default, the field is empty and, in that case, the service ignores it.
