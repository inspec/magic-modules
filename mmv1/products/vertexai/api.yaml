                Assigns input data to the training, validation, and test sets so that the distribution of values found in the categorical column (as specified by the `key` field) is mirrored within each split. The fraction values determine the relative sizes of the splits. For example, if the specified column has three values, with 50% of the rows having value "A", 25% value "B", and 25% value "C", and the split fractions are specified as 80/10/10, then the training set will constitute 80% of the training data, with about 50% of the training set rows having the value "A" for the specified column, about 25% having the value "B", and about 25% having the value "C". Only the top 500 occurring values are used; any values not in the top 500 values are randomly assigned to a split. If less than three rows contain a specific value, those rows are randomly assigned. Supported only for tabular Datasets.

The schema is defined as an OpenAPI 3.0.2 [Schema Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.2.md#schemaObject). The schema files that can be used here are found in gs://google-cloud-aiplatform/schema/dataset/annotation/ , note that the chosen schema must be consistent with metadata of the Dataset specified by dataset_id. Only Annotations that both match this schema and belong to DataItems not ignored by the split method are used in respectively training, validation or test role, depending on the role of the DataItem they are on. When used in conjunction with annotations_filter, the Annotations used for training are filtered by both annotations_filter and annotation_schema_uri.

The first line in the file is the header, containing comma-separated field names. Uses GcsSource. * `tf-record` The TFRecord format, where each instance is a single record in tfrecord syntax. Uses GcsSource. * `tf-record-gzip` Similar to `tf-record`, but the file is gzipped. Uses GcsSource. * `bigquery` Each instance is a single row in BigQuery. Uses BigQuerySource. * `file-list` Each line of the file is the location of an instance to process, uses `gcs_source` field of the InputConfig object. If this Model doesn't support any of these formats it means it cannot be used with a BatchPredictionJob. However, if it has supported_deployment_resources_types, it could serve online predictions by using PredictionService.Predict or PredictionService.Explain.

Vertex AI forwards requests sent using projects.locations.endpoints.predict to this path on the container's IP address and port. Vertex AI then returns the container's response in the API response. For example, if you set this field to `/foo`, then when Vertex AI receives a prediction request, it forwards the request body in a POST request to the `/foo` path on the port of your container specified by the first value of this `ModelContainerSpec`'s ports field. If you don't specify this field, it defaults to the following value when you deploy this Model to an Endpoint: /v1/endpoints/ENDPOINT/deployedModels/DEPLOYED_MODEL:predict The placeholders in this value are replaced as follows: * ENDPOINT: The last segment (following `endpoints/`)of the Endpoint.name][] field of the Endpoint where this Model has been deployed. (Vertex AI makes this value available to your container code as the [`AIP_ENDPOINT_ID` environment variable](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements#aip-variables).) * DEPLOYED_MODEL: DeployedModel.id of the `DeployedModel`.

The container image is ingested upon ModelService.UploadModel, stored internally, and this original path is afterwards not used. To learn about the requirements for the Docker image itself, see [Custom container requirements](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements#).

                Output only. When this Model is deployed, its prediction resources are described by the `prediction_resources` field of the Endpoint.deployed_models object. Because not all Models support all resource configuration types, the configuration types this Model supports are listed here. If no configuration types are listed, the Model cannot be deployed to an Endpoint and does not support online predictions (PredictionService.Predict or PredictionService.Explain). Such a Model can serve predictions by using a BatchPredictionJob, if it has at least one entry each in supported_input_storage_formats and supported_output_storage_formats.

                Output only. The formats this Model supports in BatchPredictionJob.output_config. If both PredictSchemata.instance_schema_uri and PredictSchemata.prediction_schema_uri exist, the predictions are returned together with their instances. In other words, the prediction has the original instance data first, followed by the actual prediction content (as per the schema). The possible formats are: * `jsonl` The JSON Lines format, where each prediction is a single line. Uses GcsDestination. * `csv` The CSV format, where each prediction is a single comma-separated line. The first line in the file is the header, containing comma-separated field names. Uses GcsDestination. * `bigquery` Each prediction is a single row in a BigQuery table, uses BigQueryDestination . If this Model doesn't support any of these formats it means it cannot be used with a BatchPredictionJob. However, if it has supported_deployment_resources_types, it could serve online predictions by using PredictionService.Predict or PredictionService.Explain.

                User provided version aliases so that a model version can be referenced via alias (i.e. `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/models/{model_id}@{version_alias}` instead of auto-generated version id (i.e. `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/models/{model_id}@{version_id})`. The format is a-z{0,126}[a-z0-9] to distinguish from version_id. A default version alias will be created for the first version of the model, and there must be exactly one default version alias for a model.
