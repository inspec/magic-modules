                                  This is a single float value and will be used to add noise to all the features. Use this field when all features are normalized to have the same distribution: scale to range [0, 1], [-1, 1] or z-scoring, where features are normalized to have 0-mean and 1-variance. Learn more about [normalization](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/data-prep/transform/normalization). For best results the recommended value is about 10% - 20% of the standard deviation of the input feature. Refer to section 3.2 of the SmoothGrad paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03825.pdf. Defaults to 0.1. If the distribution is different per feature, set feature_noise_sigma instead for each feature.

Vertex AI forwards requests sent using projects.locations.endpoints.predict to this path on the container's IP address and port. Vertex AI then returns the container's response in the API response. For example, if you set this field to `/foo`, then when Vertex AI receives a prediction request, it forwards the request body in a POST request to the `/foo` path on the port of your container specified by the first value of this `ModelContainerSpec`'s ports field. If you don't specify this field, it defaults to the following value when you deploy this Model to an Endpoint: /v1/endpoints/ENDPOINT/deployedModels/DEPLOYED_MODEL:predict The placeholders in this value are replaced as follows: * ENDPOINT: The last segment (following `endpoints/`)of the Endpoint.name][] field of the Endpoint where this Model has been deployed. (Vertex AI makes this value available to your container code as the [`AIP_ENDPOINT_ID` environment variable](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements#aip-variables).) * DEPLOYED_MODEL: DeployedModel.id of the `DeployedModel`.

Vertex AI also sends [liveness and health checks](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements#liveness) to this port. If you do not specify this field, it defaults to following value: ```json [ { "containerPort": 8080 } ] ``` Vertex AI does not use ports other than the first one listed. This field corresponds to the `ports` field of the Kubernetes Containers [v1 core API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.23/#container-v1-core).

Vertex AI intermittently sends GET requests to this path on the container's IP address and port to check that the container is healthy. Read more about [health checks](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements#health). For example, if you set this field to `/bar`, then Vertex AI intermittently sends a GET request to the `/bar` path on the port of your container specified by the first value of this `ModelContainerSpec`'s ports field. If you don't specify this field, it defaults to the following value when you deploy this Model to an Endpoint: /v1/endpoints/ENDPOINT/deployedModels/ DEPLOYED_MODEL:predict The placeholders in this value are replaced as follows: * ENDPOINT: The last segment (following `endpoints/`)of the Endpoint.name][] field of the Endpoint where this Model has been deployed. (Vertex AI makes this value available to your container code as the [`AIP_ENDPOINT_ID` environment variable](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements#aip-variables).) * DEPLOYED_MODEL: DeployedModel.id of the `DeployedModel`.

                      If populated, only returns attributions that have output_index contained in output_indices. It must be an ndarray of integers, with the same shape of the output it's explaining. If not populated, returns attributions for top_k indices of outputs. If neither top_k nor output_indices is populated, returns the argmax index of the outputs. Only applicable to Models that predict multiple outputs (e,g, multi-class Models that predict multiple classes).

The schema is defined as an OpenAPI 3.0.2 [Schema Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.2.md#schemaObject). AutoML tabular Models always have this field populated by Vertex AI. Note: The URI given on output may be different, including the URI scheme, than the one given on input. The output URI will point to a location where the user only has a read access.

                      Immutable. HTTP path on the container to send prediction requests to. Vertex AI forwards requests sent using projects.locations.endpoints.predict to this path on the container's IP address and port. Vertex AI then returns the container's response in the API response. For example, if you set this field to `/foo`, then when Vertex AI receives a prediction request, it forwards the request body in a POST request to the `/foo` path on the port of your container specified by the first value of this `ModelContainerSpec`'s ports field. If you don't specify this field, it defaults to the following value when you deploy this Model to an Endpoint: /v1/endpoints/ENDPOINT/deployedModels/DEPLOYED_MODEL:predict The placeholders in this value are replaced as follows: * ENDPOINT: The last segment (following `endpoints/`)of the Endpoint.name][] field of the Endpoint where this Model has been deployed. (Vertex AI makes this value available to your container code as the [`AIP_ENDPOINT_ID` environment variable](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements#aip-variables).) * DEPLOYED_MODEL: DeployedModel.id of the `DeployedModel`.

This URI must identify an image in Artifact Registry or Container Registry. Learn more about the [container publishing requirements](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements#publishing), including permissions requirements for the Vertex AI Service Agent. The container image is ingested upon ModelService.UploadModel, stored internally, and this original path is afterwards not used. To learn about the requirements for the Docker image itself, see [Custom container requirements](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements#).

Specify this field as an array of executable and arguments, similar to a Docker `CMD`'s "default parameters" form. If you don't specify this field but do specify the command field, then the command from the `command` field runs without any additional arguments.

In order for environment variables to be expanded, reference them by using the following syntax: $( VARIABLE_NAME) Note that this differs from Bash variable expansion, which does not use parentheses. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string is used unchanged. To avoid variable expansion, you can escape this syntax with `$$`; for example: $$(VARIABLE_NAME) This field corresponds to the `args` field of the Kubernetes Containers [v1 core API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.23/#container-v1-core).

When set to `true`, the batch prediction output changes based on the `predictions_format` field of the BatchPredictionJob.output_config object: * `bigquery`: output includes a column named `explanation`. The value is a struct that conforms to the Explanation object. * `jsonl`: The JSON objects on each line include an additional entry keyed `explanation`. The value of the entry is a JSON object that conforms to the Explanation object. * `csv`: Generating explanations for CSV format is not supported. If this field is set to true, either the Model.explanation_spec or explanation_spec must be populated.

          The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).

                      Immutable. HTTP path on the container to send prediction requests to. Vertex AI forwards requests sent using projects.locations.endpoints.predict to this path on the container's IP address and port. Vertex AI then returns the container's response in the API response. For example, if you set this field to `/foo`, then when Vertex AI receives a prediction request, it forwards the request body in a POST request to the `/foo` path on the port of your container specified by the first value of this `ModelContainerSpec`'s ports field. If you don't specify this field, it defaults to the following value when you deploy this Model to an Endpoint: /v1/endpoints/ENDPOINT/deployedModels/DEPLOYED_MODEL:predict The placeholders in this value are replaced as follows: * ENDPOINT: The last segment (following `endpoints/`)of the Endpoint.name][] field of the Endpoint where this Model has been deployed. (Vertex AI makes this value available to your container code as the [`AIP_ENDPOINT_ID` environment variable](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements#aip-variables).) * DEPLOYED_MODEL: DeployedModel.id of the `DeployedModel`.

Specify this field as an array of executable and arguments, similar to a Docker `CMD`'s "default parameters" form. If you don't specify this field but do specify the command field, then the command from the `command` field runs without any additional arguments.

                      Immutable. HTTP path on the container to send prediction requests to. Vertex AI forwards requests sent using projects.locations.endpoints.predict to this path on the container's IP address and port. Vertex AI then returns the container's response in the API response. For example, if you set this field to `/foo`, then when Vertex AI receives a prediction request, it forwards the request body in a POST request to the `/foo` path on the port of your container specified by the first value of this `ModelContainerSpec`'s ports field. If you don't specify this field, it defaults to the following value when you deploy this Model to an Endpoint: /v1/endpoints/ENDPOINT/deployedModels/DEPLOYED_MODEL:predict The placeholders in this value are replaced as follows: * ENDPOINT: The last segment (following `endpoints/`)of the Endpoint.name][] field of the Endpoint where this Model has been deployed. (Vertex AI makes this value available to your container code as the [`AIP_ENDPOINT_ID` environment variable](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements#aip-variables).) * DEPLOYED_MODEL: DeployedModel.id of the `DeployedModel`.

This URI must identify an image in Artifact Registry or Container Registry. Learn more about the [container publishing requirements](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements#publishing), including permissions requirements for the Vertex AI Service Agent. The container image is ingested upon ModelService.UploadModel, stored internally, and this original path is afterwards not used. To learn about the requirements for the Docker image itself, see [Custom container requirements](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements#).

Additionally, the command and args fields can reference these variables. Later entries in this list can also reference earlier entries. For example, the following example sets the variable `VAR_2` to have the value `foo bar`: ```json [ { "name": "VAR_1", "value": "foo" }, { "name": "VAR_2", "value": "$(VAR_1) bar" } ] ``` If you switch the order of the variables in the example, then the expansion does not occur.

This overrides the container's [`CMD`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd). Specify this field as an array of executable and arguments, similar to a Docker `CMD`'s "default parameters" form. If you don't specify this field but do specify the command field, then the command from the `command` field runs without any additional arguments. See the [Kubernetes documentation about how the `command` and `args` fields interact with a container's `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#notes). If you don't specify this field and don't specify the `command` field, then the container's [`ENTRYPOINT`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd) and `CMD` determine what runs based on their default behavior.

You cannot reference environment variables set in the Docker image. In order for environment variables to be expanded, reference them by using the following syntax: $( VARIABLE_NAME) Note that this differs from Bash variable expansion, which does not use parentheses. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string is used unchanged. To avoid variable expansion, you can escape this syntax with `$$`; for example: $$(VARIABLE_NAME) This field corresponds to the `args` field of the Kubernetes Containers [v1 core API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.23/#container-v1-core).

The order of columns is determined by the BigQuery column order, unless included_fields is populated. included_fields must be populated for specifying field orders. * For `jsonl`, if each line of the JSONL input is an object, included_fields must be populated for specifying field orders. * Does not apply to `csv`, `file-list`, `tf-record`, or `tf-record-gzip`. If not specified, Vertex AI converts the batch prediction input as follows: * For `bigquery` and `csv`, the behavior is the same as `array`.

                Specification of a container for serving predictions. Some fields in this message correspond to fields in the [Kubernetes Container v1 core specification](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.23/#container-v1-core).

                      Immutable. HTTP path on the container to send prediction requests to. Vertex AI forwards requests sent using projects.locations.endpoints.predict to this path on the container's IP address and port. Vertex AI then returns the container's response in the API response. For example, if you set this field to `/foo`, then when Vertex AI receives a prediction request, it forwards the request body in a POST request to the `/foo` path on the port of your container specified by the first value of this `ModelContainerSpec`'s ports field. If you don't specify this field, it defaults to the following value when you deploy this Model to an Endpoint: /v1/endpoints/ENDPOINT/deployedModels/DEPLOYED_MODEL:predict The placeholders in this value are replaced as follows: * ENDPOINT: The last segment (following `endpoints/`)of the Endpoint.name][] field of the Endpoint where this Model has been deployed. (Vertex AI makes this value available to your container code as the [`AIP_ENDPOINT_ID` environment variable](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements#aip-variables).) * DEPLOYED_MODEL: DeployedModel.id of the `DeployedModel`. (Vertex AI makes this value available to your container code as the [`AIP_DEPLOYED_MODEL_ID` environment variable](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements#aip-variables).)

                      Required. Immutable. URI of the Docker image to be used as the custom container for serving predictions. This URI must identify an image in Artifact Registry or Container Registry. Learn more about the [container publishing requirements](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements#publishing), including permissions requirements for the Vertex AI Service Agent. The container image is ingested upon ModelService.UploadModel, stored internally, and this original path is afterwards not used. To learn about the requirements for the Docker image itself, see [Custom container requirements](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements#). You can use the URI to one of Vertex AI's [pre-built container images for prediction](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/pre-built-containers) in this field.

Additionally, the command and args fields can reference these variables. Later entries in this list can also reference earlier entries. For example, the following example sets the variable `VAR_2` to have the value `foo bar`: ```json [ { "name": "VAR_1", "value": "foo" }, { "name": "VAR_2", "value": "$(VAR_1) bar" } ] ``` If you switch the order of the variables in the example, then the expansion does not occur.

This overrides the container's [`CMD`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd). Specify this field as an array of executable and arguments, similar to a Docker `CMD`'s "default parameters" form. If you don't specify this field but do specify the command field, then the command from the `command` field runs without any additional arguments. See the [Kubernetes documentation about how the `command` and `args` fields interact with a container's `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#notes). If you don't specify this field and don't specify the `command` field, then the container's [`ENTRYPOINT`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd) and `CMD` determine what runs based on their default behavior.

In this field, you can reference [environment variables set by Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements#aip-variables) and environment variables set in the env field. You cannot reference environment variables set in the Docker image. In order for environment variables to be expanded, reference them by using the following syntax: $( VARIABLE_NAME) Note that this differs from Bash variable expansion, which does not use parentheses. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string is used unchanged. To avoid variable expansion, you can escape this syntax with `$$`; for example: $$(VARIABLE_NAME) This field corresponds to the `args` field of the Kubernetes Containers [v1 core API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.23/#container-v1-core).
