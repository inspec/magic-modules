        Service acts as a top-level container that manages a set of Routes and Configurations which implement a network service. Service exists to provide a singular abstraction which can be access controlled, reasoned about, and which encapsulates software lifecycle decisions such as rollout policy and team resource ownership. Service acts only as an orchestrator of the underlying Routes and Configurations (much as a kubernetes Deployment orchestrates ReplicaSets). The Service's controller will track the statuses of its owned Configuration and Route, reflecting their statuses and conditions as its own.

                      Uses the "status.latestReadyRevisionName" of the Service to determine the traffic target. When it changes, traffic will automatically migrate from the prior "latest ready" revision to the new one. This field must be false if RevisionName is set. This field defaults to true otherwise. If the field is set to true on Status, this means that the Revision was resolved from the Service's latest ready revision.

        Service acts as a top-level container that manages a set of Routes and Configurations which implement a network service. Service exists to provide a singular abstraction which can be access controlled, reasoned about, and which encapsulates software lifecycle decisions such as rollout policy and team resource ownership. Service acts only as an orchestrator of the underlying Routes and Configurations (much as a kubernetes Deployment orchestrates ReplicaSets). The Service's controller will track the statuses of its owned Configuration and Route, reflecting their statuses and conditions as its own.

Exit status of 0 is treated as live/healthy and non-zero is unhealthy.

                      Uses the "status.latestReadyRevisionName" of the Service to determine the traffic target. When it changes, traffic will automatically migrate from the prior "latest ready" revision to the new one. This field must be false if RevisionName is set. This field defaults to true otherwise. If the field is set to true on Status, this means that the Revision was resolved from the Service's latest ready revision.
